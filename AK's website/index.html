                <p>"Home is where the heart is, but the world is where my heart dreams to be." Living in Tamil Nadu, I’m fueled by a passion for exploring new places and making lifelong connections along the way. With BCA and MBA degrees, I’m driven by curiosity, positivity, and a love for building meaningful relationships. A vegetarian and an avid cook, I find joy in creating dishes that bring people together. For me, life is all about laughter, loved ones, and the endless adventures that await!</p>
